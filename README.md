## About The Sparks Foundation
![](img1.png)

[The Sparks Foundation](https://thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/)  mission is to inspire students, help them innovate, and let them integrate to build the next generation humankind. To inspire, motivate, and encourage students to learn, create, and help build a better society. To teach new ways of thinking, to innovate and solve the problems on their own. We help the students to integrate and help each other, learn from each other, and do well together.

Their Vision Statement : A world of enabled and connected little minds, building future. Our Mission Statement To inspire students, help them innovate and let them integrate to build the next generation humankind.

## Getting Started
Welcome to my Getting Started Guide. Looking for a Data Science Projects Every Beginner should add to the Portfolio, that enhances and improves your knowledge in the data science domain and is easy to get started with? You’ve come to the right place. I am Preet Mehta, an aspiring data scientist, data enthusiast and a professional graphics designer since 2014. Here you will find the projects in 3 categories:  
1. Beginner
2. Intermediate
3. Advanced

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

# key Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them


## :bulb: Working
Give examples
Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

Give the example
And repeat

until finished
End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

Running the tests
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

Break down into end to end tests
Explain what these tests test and why

Give an example
And coding style tests
Explain what these tests test and why

Give an example
Deployment
Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

Built With
